 1. Optimizing CI/CD Pipelines (Reduce Deployment Time by 40%)
 Parallel Execution: Run tests and builds in parallel using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
 Docker Caching: Use multi-stage builds and layer caching to speed up builds.
 Artifact Storage: Store build artifacts (e.g., in S3, Nexus, or JFrog) to avoid redundant builds.
 Incremental Deployments: Use Blue-Green or Canary deployments to reduce downtime.
 Optimized Runners: Use self-hosted runners or spot instances for faster execution.

 2. Automating Infrastructure Provisioning (Reduce Manual Errors by 60%)
 Terraform or Ansible: Automate infrastructure provisioning to eliminate human errors.
 Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Maintain version-controlled infrastructure using Git.
 Predefined Templates: Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform modules for consistency.
 Automated Testing: Validate infrastructure changes with terraform validate or kitchen test.
 Role-Based Access: Use IAM policies to restrict manual changes.

 3. Designing Scalable Kubernetes Architecture (Ensure High Availability)
 Auto-Scaling: Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler.
 Load Balancing: Deploy Ingress Controllers (e.g., Nginx, ALB) to distribute traffic.
 Efficient Resource Allocation: Set requests & limits for CPU and memory.
 Rolling Updates: Use kubectl rollout or Helm for zero-downtime deployments.
 Multi-AZ Deployments: Ensure nodes are distributed across Availability Zones.

 4. Reducing AWS Costs (Cut Expenses by 20%)
 Right-Sizing: Use AWS Compute Optimizer to pick the right EC2 instance sizes.
 Spot & Reserved Instances: Use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads and Reserved Instances for long-term savings.
 Auto-Scaling: Dynamically scale EC2, RDS, and ECS resources based on demand.
 S3 Lifecycle Policies: Move infrequent data to Glacier for cost savings.
 Monitor & Optimize: Use AWS Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, and Budgets to track and cut unnecessary spending.
